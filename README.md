### Project Description
Monstre enables easy onboarding onto the Web3.0 economy through Solana Pay. One would not need to have any knowledge about Solana, or know that the backend is Solana to participate. This enables frictionless onboarding, ensuring the underbanked can also participate in Web3 on Solana. 

### Why we built it
Solana is a blockchain for the masses. However, to participate in Web3.0 there are hoops to pass through for the non crypto savvy and it is very diffcult for the underbanked to to have any $SOL into their wallet without a credit card or a bank account. Our products and services enables seamless onboarding, where we bridge off-chain Fiat with on-chain assets. 

### The Monstre Crypto Cash Point
This is the flow of a user obtaining SPL-Tokens (can be custom SPL-Tokens or Stablecoins like USDC) into their non-custodial wallet. 
1. Pays Merchant with fiat at a retail store 
2. Gets transferred a whitelist token
3. Inputs the amount at the homepage (eg $100 LEM Tokens purchased)
4. Scans QR code at checkout to get Tokens straight into their wallet
5. Some SOL is also sent to cover initial transaction fees the user may need. (eg sending tokens to friends or participating in DeFi)

### Quick Start

```
npm install
npm run dev
```
